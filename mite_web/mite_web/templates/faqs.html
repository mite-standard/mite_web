                        <td>Yes, please also add any covalently bound co-factor/prosthetic groups to prevent ambiguity regarding the substrate specificity of the tailoring enzyme, and add a description (see e.g. <a class="custom-link" href="{{ url_for('routes.repository', mite_acc='MITE0000005') }}">MITE0000005</a>). Instead of drawing the cofactor yourself, consider copying the SMILES from e.g. PubChem. Do not draw any of the peptidic structure of the carrier protein.</td>

Instead, such enzymes can be added as "Auxiliary Enzymes" to the enzyme that does the actual tailoring.</td>

While such resonance forms can be described by specifying multiple possible reaction SMARTS (or SMILES), they should be covered only if they are the reaction center and essential for the reaction to take place.</td>

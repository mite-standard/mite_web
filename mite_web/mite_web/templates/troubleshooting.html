            <p class="lead my-2">Preparing reaction SMARTS of complex enzymatic reactions can sometimes lead to validation errors, even though the reaction drawing appears correct. Sometimes, this is due to user-introduced errors, but it can also be caused by reaction SMARTS formatting errors or ambiguities. These errors may pop up during the validation step, when a new MITE entry is submitted. Below are several known issues and ways to solve them.</p>

                        <td>The validation functionality of MITE fixes such incorrect formatting automatically. If you want to fix the reaction SMARTS manually,  add square brackets '[]' around the heteroatoms to (e.g. '[#6:5](-Cl:7)-[#6:6]' to '[#6:5](-[Cl:7])-[#6:6]'</td>
